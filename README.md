The Dependencies used and why:
Babel: I used babel to be able to support older versions of javascript so that most browsers can run the app instead of running into errors because thy dont understand latest version of javascript (ES5) 
WebPack: Web pack packs up or bundles up all the dependencies we need for our app to run. It builds a dependency graph for our app and depending on the graph it creates a package that holds the bare minimum number of files needed that can be added to the html page and used throught the app
React-related: React and React-Dom. React is a javascript ui library that is used to build the frontend. React-DOM helps react interact with the browser and manipulate the document element.
